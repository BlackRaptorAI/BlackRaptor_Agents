# The Executive Advisory Council

**A tough, evidence-driven team of AI advisor agents that helps you build
the right company.**

Twelve advisor seats — product strategy, market insight, pricing, finance,
go-to-market, revenue, growth, technology & data, people, ethics & legal,
fundraising — convened by an orchestrator that challenges every input
before it reaches you. The Council argues in front of you and hands you
decision-ready views with the disagreement preserved. **You decide; it
advises.** Read [VISION.md](VISION.md) for why this exists and what makes
it different.

> **The product anchor + evidence gate ship in the shared bridge.** `product-manager`
> (the merged product-strategy + delivery role) and `evidence-auditor` (the council's
> evidence gate) live in the **`blackraptor-bridge`** plugin, which is **auto-installed**
> alongside this council. The `council-orchestrator` convenes `product-manager` as the
> product/strategy anchor exactly as before — it just isn't a council-only file.

## Quickstart (Claude Code / Cowork)

1. Copy `agents/*.md` into your project's `.claude/agents/` directory.
2. Copy `COUNCIL.md` and `templates/` into your project root.
3. **Fill in `BUSINESS-CONTEXT.md`** from `templates/business-context.md`.
   This is not optional — a council that doesn't know your company gives
   conventional wisdom, and the orchestrator refuses to convene without it.
4. Ask: *"Convene the council on ..."* — the orchestrator selects seats,
   enforces the challenge protocol, and returns a decision-ready view.

> **Installed via the plugin marketplace?** The `council` skill ships with it, so
> you can just say *"convene the council"* (or `/council`) — it grounds itself in
> `BUSINESS-CONTEXT.md` and runs steps 3–4 for you. Manual copy (above) still works
> if you're not using the plugin.

## Start lean — don't activate all twelve

Add seats as your company earns them (`COUNCIL.md` §5). Start with the
orchestrator, the core four (product, market, pricing, finance), and
ethics-governance. A council of twelve consulted on "do ten customers want
this?" is theater. Copy only the agent files for active seats if you want
the discipline enforced by absence.

## What makes this different

- **No sycophancy, structurally.** Independent parallel drafts, anonymized
  cross-review, a challenge protocol every input must survive, and
  adversarial mode for consequential calls. Not "be critical" as a vibe —
  mechanisms.
- **Balanced evidence, always.** Confidence labels on claims, steelman
  for/against, a mandatory "What You Lose" cost in every recommendation,
  and dissent preserved on the record.
- **Customer-focused by charter.** Every seat optimizes for world-class
  customer experience and loyalty — checked against real voice-of-customer
  evidence, never an imagined customer.
- **A human decides.** Consequential calls carry a human signature. The
  one executing seat (growth-engine) runs behind human-in-the-loop
  approval and ethics review.

## Model assignments (tiered by decision stakes)

Each agent's frontmatter assigns the Claude model best suited to its seat.
The council tiers by **decision stakes** — how expensive a subtle
reasoning failure is, and how reversible the resulting decision — not by
task volume:

| Tier | Seats | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Opus** | `council-orchestrator`, `finance`, `ethics-governance`, `fundraising-ir` | Highest judgment stakes: the orchestrator synthesizes disagreement (a subtle failure corrupts everything downstream); finance owns capital allocation and downside math; ethics-governance holds legal judgment and BLOCK authority; fundraising-ir analyzes terms where a missed nuance costs equity. |
| **Sonnet** | `market-insight`, `pricing-strategy`, `gtm-strategy`, `revenue`, `growth-engine`, `technology-strategy`, `people-org` | Analysis and strategy seats: strong reasoning over sources and frameworks, invoked frequently, cost-efficient. |

> `product-manager` (the product anchor) and `evidence-auditor` (the evidence gate)
> run at `sonnet` and `opus` respectively but live in the shared **`blackraptor-bridge`**
> plugin, auto-installed with this council — so their tiering is documented there.

There is deliberately no cheaper volume tier: every council output is
advice a CEO may act on, so the quality floor is uniform. Assignments are
coaching records — if a seat under-reasons in practice, promote it (one
line in its frontmatter). Ports should preserve the tiering with their
vendor's equivalents (see [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md)).

## Requirements & platforms

The Council's potency comes from its mechanics (independent drafts,
anonymized review, challenge protocol), which require an **agent runtime**
— Claude Code or Cowork natively, or a faithful port (OpenAI Agents SDK,
CrewAI, LangGraph): see [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md). **There is
deliberately no single-prompt "chat mode"** — one chat window cannot keep
five advisors honestly independent, and we don't ship degraded versions.

## Honest limits

An AI council models the world; it is not the world. It gives you rigor,
structure, memory, and tireless challenge — genuinely valuable and rare —
but internal coherence is not external truth. Use it to think harder and
decide better, then go get ground truth: real customers, real dollars,
real market signal. The agents are not lawyers, accountants, or investment
advisors, and they will tell you when licensed professionals are required.

## Companion project: development-team-agents

The Council answers *"are we building the right company?"* Its companion,
**[BlackRaptor Agents — development](https://github.com/BlackRaptorAI/BlackRaptor_Agents/tree/main/development)**,
answers the question downstream of it: *"are we building the thing right?"*
— a governed AI development team (architect, engineers, security,
compliance, QA, and blocking review gates) battle-tested on production
energy-monitoring infrastructure.

The two teams connect through one artifact: the Council's signed
**Definition Brief** (`templates/definition-brief.md`) is the input the
development team builds against. Same operating philosophy (advise →
decide → enforce, preserved dissent, a human signs), same license, same
authors. Run both and you have the full loop: decide what and why, then
build it right.
