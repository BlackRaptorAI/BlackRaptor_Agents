# Gate enforcement map (template)

For each review gate, record HOW it is enforced. Three honest categories:

- **Mechanical** — CODEOWNERS or a required CI check blocks the merge. Reliable.
- **Partial** — known paths are covered mechanically, but the concern is
  broader than those paths; the Change Record covers the rest.
- **Checklist-only** — a data-flow or behavioral property no path expresses
  (e.g. "does this send PII to the LLM"); only the Change Record covers it.

| Gate | Agent | Enforcement | Mechanism / paths | Gap covered by CR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Security — auth/authz | security-architect | Mechanical | {{AUTH_PATHS}} in CODEOWNERS + hook | New auth surfaces outside listed paths |
| Schema | data-engineer | Mechanical | {{SCHEMA_PATH}} | — |
| CI/CD + enforcement config | devops-sre | Mechanical | `.github/`, `.claude/hooks/` | — |
| Privacy — PII at rest | privacy-counsel | Partial | {{PII_PATHS}} | New PII fields elsewhere |
| Privacy — PII to LLM / cross-border | privacy-counsel | Checklist-only | — | Data-flow property |
| Domain ({{REGULATED_DOMAIN}}) | domain-compliance | Checklist-only until the module exists | (future {{DOMAIN_PATHS}}) | Eligibility/behavioral judgments |
| Compliance — control continuity | compliance-officer | Checklist-only | — | Behavior, not paths |
| Quality — tests/coverage | qa-test-engineer | Mechanical | required CI checks | Test honesty (CR + review) |

Two structural limits that make the Change Record mandatory, not optional:
CODEOWNERS requires only ONE listed owner per matching line, and it sees paths,
not behavior. Keep this map in sync with the hook, CODEOWNERS, and the CI
GATED list whenever any of them changes.
